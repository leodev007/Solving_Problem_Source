# List of Conquests	

(CPE21924, UVA10420)

## Descriptions

In Act I, Leporello is telling Donna Elvira about his master’s long list of conquests:  

“This is the list of the beauties my master has loved, a list I’ve made out myself: take a look, read it with me. In Italy six hundred and forty, in Germany two hundred and thirty-one, a hundred in France, ninety-one in Turkey; but in Spain already a thousand and three! Among them are country girls, waiting-maids, city beauties; there are countesses, baronesses, marchionesses, princesses: women of every rank, of every size, of every age.” (Madamina, il catalogo questo)

As Leporello records all the “beauties” Don Giovanni “loved” in chronological order, it is very
troublesome for him to present his master’s conquest to others because he needs to count the number
of “beauties” by their nationality each time. You are to help Leporello to count.
