A particle has initial velocity and acceleration. If its velocity after a certain time is \( v \), then what will its displacement be in twice that time?

## Input

The input will contain two integers on each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers denote the value of \( v \) (−100 ≤ \( v \) ≤ 100) and \( t \) (0 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 200) (\( t \) means at the time the particle gains that velocity).

## Output

For each line of input, print a single integer on one line denoting the displacement in double that time.
