# Decode the Mad Man

(CPE10425, UVA10222)

## Description

Once in BUET, an old professor had gone completely mad. He started talking with some peculiar words. Nobody could understand his speech and lectures. Finally, the BUET authority fell into great trouble. There was no way left to keep that man working at the university. Suddenly, a student (definitely he was a registered author at UVA ACM Chapter and held a good rank on the 24-hour Online Judge) created a program that was able to decode that professor’s speech. After his invention, everyone was relieved, and that old teacher resumed his everyday work as before.  
So, if you ever visit BUET and see a teacher talking with a microphone, which is connected to an IBM computer equipped with voice recognition software, and students are taking their lecture from the computer screen, don’t be surprised! Because now your job is to write the same program which can decode that mad teacher’s speech!
